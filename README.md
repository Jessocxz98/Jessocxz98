<!-- ### üö≤ &nbsp; My Skills

#### Self Led Learner with a Growth Mindset
* After studying Biochemistry I stumbled upon my role as a Risk and Hazard Management Consultant for the process engineering and energy sectors. I had no prior knowledge of these industries, or the work/technologies involved. I was absolutely thrown in the deep end, working on both client and internal projects from day 1 (I thrive under pressure so this was a win). I had a lot to learn from industry lingo, standards and governing bodies to essential packages such as mapping tools, risk quantification software, data processing and excel. Working for a very small, extremely busy company (less than 20 people!) I was often just given some context to start me off then left to my own devices until I had finished the project, this allowed me to really develop a process for learning what was needed by myself, and applying it to my work in a timely and productive manner. Due to the nature of the industry and the consultancy I worked for, every project was extremely varied and gave me fresh opportunities to learn and grow. After just 6 months in my role I began working remotely due to the pandemic and could adapt my processes to suit the circumstances with ease.
* Alongside my work, my interest in coding began to develop. I completed several programming courses in the evenings including Python, SQL, Web development, Ruby and AWS Machine Learning.
* Utilising Agile practices throughout Makers enabled me to focus on effective time management and to prioritise tasks accordingly. I was comfortable moving from Ruby to Javascript and for our final project, we challenged ourselves to learn Python in under 2 weeks to build our¬†TradeRunner¬†app, whilst confidently utilising Django, MySQL, the Binance API and a websocket - all unknown technologies to us at the time.

#### Innovative Collaborator and Team Player
* I have always thrived whilst working as part of a team and and have a great appreciation for team work and team success, whilst still taking ownership for my own tasks.
* During my time at RAS I regularly worked with clients in order to help them understand how they could improve their businesses and processes to comply with regulations and standards set by the Goverment. I would also work with the HSE/EA to portray this compliance and due to the subjective nature of risk when applied to safety and the environment, I would regularly have to justify the work of my peers and client in complying. Additionally, I regularaly contributed towards the IChemE Significant Learning Group, which consists of industry professionals who work together to help set and review industry guidance and standards.
* Pair programming played a huge part in my experience at Makers, I paired almost everyday for 3 months which resulted in improved code quality, communication and shared knowledge. I worked on four group projects in teams of 3-8 people following an agile product development process and developer workflows, including leading standups and retros, creating and merging pull requests, updating Trello boards and assigning tasks to my team members, which also helped give me a better understanding of leadership within a software engineering role. Daily standups and retros identified areas that needed improving, for example during the¬†Traderunner¬†project we lost a team member, putting us down to 3 members and making meaningful pair programming difficult. To solve this problem we decided to reconsider our priorities and expectations in order to focus on working together to learn the most we could about Python and our project, rather than pushing out features individually - which could compromise learning opportunities for the rest of the team.

#### Emotionally Intelligent Communicator
* Having worked in client facing roles throughout my career I'm great at being put in front of clients, liaising on tasks to create a smooth workflow, meeting deadlines and providing ideas. I know how to communicate effectively, both verbally and non verbally. I have also learned how to manage expectations and how to deal empathetically and tactfully with clients and different stakeholders, both internal and external to the company. 
* My work with RAS required me to discuss client compliance with both the client and the government. The nature of these discussions were very complex with differing opinions rising across the board. I was able to effectively manage the discussion to ensure productive final conclusions were drawn in order for us to report back to our client. Being able to adapt information and make it accessible is a skill I‚Äôve had to use throughout my career. I‚Äôm not afraid to raise questions and have conversations with people to understand/explain how something works and how it could be improved.
* The EQ curriculum at Makers was one of the most illuminating and enjoyable parts of the course for me and I am passionate about utilising EQ practices to manage stress and prevent burnout. During group projects at Makers I have had the chance to be the scrum master and hold standups and retros as well as organising the tasks for the day and delegating to pairs. This was a great introduction to agile working practices and how developers work together as a team to create projects, and quickly became one of my favourite parts of working in a group (maybe due to my love of organisation!).
* Since finishing the course at Makers, I have become a mentor to three students. I've found it to be a rewarding experience, being able to make connections and give advice, encouragement and technical help to other students.


#### Logical Thinker and Creative Problem Solver with a Keen Attention to Detail
* I've always been a logical thinker and my last role gave me a lot of opportunities to utilise this, with most projects requiring a high level of problem solving. I worked with clients in order to brainstorm ways in which to alter their processes to decrease risk in a way that worked for them financially and behaviourally. One example would be working with a chemicals manufacturer to put in place a new work shift pattern which would decrease fatigue (and therefore reduce safety risk) whilst catering to the number of employees and the preferences, responsibilities and specific skills of those employees. One example of an extremely high pressured and sensitive deadline was during the pandemic where we were handling all the risk assessments, compliance and advising on the process for the manufacture of a lipid created for the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine. I always exercise attention to detail and have experience doing so when planning and writing original material for clients, the data and information that I would document would usually be supplied to the HSE or EA in order to demonstrate compliance, meaning that a high level of attention to detail was absolutely essential in order to avoid damaged reputations or economic loss. 
* The enjoyment and satisfaction from solving problems was one of my main drivers for getting into tech. Throughout Makers I have been able to improve and apply these skills through test driven development and subsequent debugging. Paying attention to code details with these methods has been essential to acknowledging and explaining each piece of code, and thus being able to identify and fix errors. As a largely self-led course, Makers allowed me to practice an effective problem-solving cycle. Importantly one the thing I learned is how to communicate blockers when seeking assistance, including making an effort to find existing answers, talking through the relevant section of code, trying to decipher error messages and revising the questions based on feedback. Taking on new languages in a short space of time sharpened my problem solving and debugging skills. -->

<!-- ## Education

#### Makers Academy (Aug 2021 to Nov 2021)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine



## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)
